# Incompatibilities

## Unsupported Server Software

The following server software will not receive support. Although the plugin may work, it is prone to issues and deviates from the mechanics of Spigot/Paper.

* **CraftBukkit** - Action bar will not work
* **Modded hybrid servers (Arclight, Mohist, Magma, CatServer)** - Modded environments do not work well with Bukkit plugins in general, some features are reported to be broken especially around health.

## Incompatible Server Options

* **Offline Mode** - We do not support piracy in any way, and player data saving may not work.

## Incompatible Plugins

* **LoreAttributesRecoded** - Will reset health when doing certain actions. Can be fixed by disabling the health in that plugin.
* **CustomEnchants** - Will reset health when doing certain actions.
