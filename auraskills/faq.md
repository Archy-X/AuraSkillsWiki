# FAQ

### How do I remove the health and mana display above the hotbar?

Set `action_bar.idle` to false in config.yml.

### How do I use mana?

See [Mana Abilities](mana-abilities.md).

### Why does it say "Player does not have a Skills profile!" when trying to open the skills menu? / Why are the items in the skills menu missing?

Restart the server. You likely reloaded the server, which is not supported and will break things.

### Will you ever support 1.8?

No. Too much would have to be re-coded and features would be cut.

### Is there a developer API?

Yes, see [API](api.md).

### How do I uninstall the plugin and remove extra hearts

To uninstall, put the plugin back and run `skills resethealth` in the console when no players are online. Then immediately remove the plugin and restart.
